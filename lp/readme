Dscription: This folder contains code to execute Label Propagtion algorithm ona  hadoop cluster [or pseudo distributed cluster], 
make sure the input file is stored on HDFS.

Input format: The input should consist of information about one node per line, the 
source identifier should appear first followed by all target nodes which it connects to. 
Each node should be representated by an integer,starting from 0 to a maximum value.
All values should be tab delimited.

Note: Missing integer value are allowed, but the memmory will be allocated according to the maximum value.
 
Example: 
1	2	4	6
2	4	1
6	4
4	3
3	2

Execution: ./run.sh infile iterations max_node_id 

Options: 
	infile: name of the file stored on HDFS
	iterations: number of iterations of the Label Propagation algorithm
	max_node_id: maximum value of node in the dataset
